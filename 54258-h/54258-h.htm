<h2>THE CASTLE AND LAKE OF INCHIQUIN, COUNTY OF CLARE.</h2>

<p>Connemara itself, now so celebrated for its lakes and mountains,
was not less unknown a few years since than the greater
portion of the county of Clare. Without roads, or houses of
entertainment for travellers, its magnificent coast and other
scenery were necessarily unvisited by the pleasure tourists,
and but little appreciated even by their inhabitants themselves.
But Clare can no longer be said to be an unvisited district:
the recent formation of roads has opened to observation many
features of interest previously inaccessible to the traveller,
and its singular coast scenery&mdash;the most sublimely magnificent
in the British islands, if not in Europe&mdash;has at least been
made known to the public by topographical and scientific
explorers&mdash;it has become an attractive locality to artists and
pleasure tourists, and will doubtless be visited by increasing
numbers of such persons in each successive year.</p>

<p>There is however as yet in this county too great a deficiency
in the number of respectable houses of entertainment suited to
the habits of pleasure tourists; for though the wealthier and
more educated classes in the British empire are becoming
daily a more travelling and picturesque-hunting genus, they
will not be content to live on fine scenery, but must have food
for the body as well as for the mind; and truly they must be
enthusiastic lovers of the picturesque, who, to gratify their
taste, will subject themselves to the vicissitudes of such an uncertain
climate as ours, without the certainty of such consoling
comforts as are afforded in a clean and comfortable inn.</p>

<p>Yet we do not despair of seeing this want soon supplied.
Wherever there is a demand for a commodity it will not be
long wanting; and the people of Clare are too sagacious not
to perceive, however slowly, the practical wisdom of holding
out every inducement of this kind to those who might be disposed
to visit them and spend their money among them.
The first step necessary, however, to produce such results in
any little frequented district, is to make its objects of interest
known to the public by the pencil and the pen&mdash;the rest will
follow in due course; and our best efforts, such as they are,
shall not be unexerted towards effecting such an important
good as well for Clare as for many other as yet little known
localities of our country.</p>

<p>Clare is indeed on many accounts deserving of greater attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
than it has hitherto received. It is a county rich in
attractions for the geologist and naturalist, and interesting in
the highest degree to the lovers of the picturesque. With a
surface singularly broken and diversified, full of mountains,
hills, lakes, and rivers, dotted all over with every class of ancient
remains, its scenery is peculiarly Irish, and though of a
somewhat melancholy aspect, it is never wanting in a poetic
and historic interest. Such a district is not indeed exactly
suited to the tastes of the common scenery-hunter, for it possesses
but little of that woody and artificially adorned scenery
which he requires, and can alone enjoy; and hence it has usually
been described by tourists and topographers with a coldness
which shows how little its peculiarities had impressed their
feelings, and how incompetent they were to communicate to
others a just estimate of its character. Let us take as an
example the notice given by the writers of Lewis’s Topographical
Dictionary, of one of the Clare beauties of which the
natives are most proud&mdash;the caverns called the To-meens or
To-mines, near Kiltanan:&mdash;</p>

<p>“At Kiltanan is a succession of limestone caverns, through
which a rivulet takes its course: these are much visited in
summer; many petrified shells are found in the limestone,
some of which are nearly perfect, and&mdash;<em>very curious</em>!”</p>

<p>This it must be confessed is cold enough; but the description
of the same locality given by our friend the author of
the Guide through Ireland, is, as our readers will see, not a
whit warmer. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A mile from Tulla is Kiltanan, the handsome residence
of James Moloney, Esq.; and in addition to the pleasure of a
well-kept residence, in a naked and sadly neglected country,
<em>some interest</em> is excited by the subterraneous course of the
rivulet called the To-meens, which waters this demesne!”</p>

<p>Now, would any person be induced by such descriptions as
those to visit the said To-meens? We suspect not. But hear
with what delight a native writer of this county actually
revels in a description of these remarkable caves:&mdash;</p>

<p>“About a mile N. W. of Tulla lies the river of Kiltanan, and
Milltown, famous for its ever-amazing and elegant subterraneous
curiosities, called the To-mines: they form a part of the
river, midway between Kiltanan House and the Castle of
Milltown, extending under ground for a space, which (from
its invisible winding banks and crystal meanders) may reasonably
be computed a quarter of an English mile: they are
vaulted, and sheltered with a solid rock, transmitting a sufficiency
of light and air by intermediate chinks and apertures
gradually offering at certain intervals.</p>

<p>At each side of this Elysian-like river are roomy passages
or rather apartments, freely communicating one with the
other, and scarcely obvious to any inclemency whatsoever:
they are likewise decorated with a sandy beach level along to
walk on, whilst the curious spectators are crowned with garlands
of ivy, hanging in triplets from the impending rocky
shades: numbers of the sporting game, the wily fox, the
wary hare, and the multiplying rabbit, &amp;c. merrily parading in
view of their own singular and various absconding haunts
and retreats. Ingenious nature thus entertains her welcome
visitants from the entrance to the extremity of the To-mines.
Lo! when parting liberally rewarded, and amply satisfied
with such egregious and wonderful exhibitions, a bridge or
arch over the same river, curiously composed of solid stone,
appears to them as a lively representation of an artificial one.</p>

<p>What can the much boasted of Giants’ Causeway, in the north
of this kingdom, produce but scenes of horror and obscurity?
whilst the To-mines of the barony of Tulla, like unto the artificial
beauties of the Latomi of Syracuse, freely exhibit the
most natural and pleasing appearances.</p>

<p>Let the literati and curious, after taking the continental
tour of Europe, praise and even write of the imaginary beauties
and natural curiosities of Italy and Switzerland&mdash;pray,
let them also, on a cool reflection, repair to the county of
Clare, view and touch upon the truly subterraneous and
really unartificial curiosities of the To-mines: they will impartially
admit that these naturally enchanting rarities may
be freely visited, and generously treated of, by the ingenious
and learned of this and after ages.”&mdash;<cite>A Short Tour, or an
Impartial and Accurate Description of the County of Clare,
by John Lloyd, Ennis; 1780.</cite></p>

<p>Excellent. Mr Lloyd! Your style is indeed a <em>little</em> peculiar,
and what some would think extravagant and grotesque;
but you describe with feeling, and we shall certainly visit your
To-meens next summer. But in the mean time we must notice
another Clare lion, of which you have given us no account&mdash;the
lake and castle, which we have drawn as an embellishment
to our present number. This is a locality respecting the
beauty of which there can be no difference of opinion: it has
all the circumstances which give interest to a landscape&mdash;wood,
water, lake, mountain, and ancient ruin&mdash;and the effect
of their combination is singularly enhanced by the surprise
created by the appearance of a scene so delightful in a district
wild, rocky, and unimproved.</p>

<p>The lake of Inchiquin is situated in the parish of Kilnaboy,
barony of Inchiquin, and is about two miles and a half in circumference.
It is bounded on its western side by a range of
hills rugged but richly wooded, and rising abruptly from its
margin; and on its southern side, the domain surrounding the
residence of the Burton family, and the ornamental grounds
of Adelphi, the residence of W. and F. Fitzgerald, Esqrs. contribute
to adorn a scene of remarkable natural beauty. One
solitary island alone appears on its surface, unless that be
ranked as one on which the ancient castle is situated, and
which may originally have been insulated, though no longer
so. The castle, which is situated at the northern side of the
lake, though greatly dilapidated, is still a picturesque and interesting
ruin, consisting of the remains of a barbican tower,
keep, and old mansion-house attached to it; and its situation
on a rocky island or peninsula standing out in the smooth
water, with its grey walls relieved by the dark masses of the
wooded hills behind, is eminently striking and imposing.</p>

<p>It is from this island or peninsula that the barony takes its
name; and from this also the chief of the O’Briens, the Marquis
of Thomond, derives his more ancient title of Earl of Inchiquin.
For a long period it was the principal residence of
the chiefs of this great family, to one of whom it unquestionably
owes its origin; but we have not been able to ascertain
with certainty the name of its founder, or date of its erection.
There is, however, every reason to ascribe its foundation to
Tiege O’Brien, king or lord of Thomond, who died, according
to the Annals of the Four Masters, in 1466, as he is the
first of his name on record who made it his residence, and as
its architectural features are most strictly characteristic of
the style of the age in which he flourished.</p>

<p>But though the erection of this castle is properly to be
ascribed to the O’Briens, it is a great error in the writers of
Lewis’s Topographical Dictionary to state that it has been
from time immemorial the property of the O’Brien family.
The locality, as its name indicates, and as history and tradition
assure us, was the ancient residence of the O’Quins, a
family of equal antiquity with the O’Briens, and of the same
stock&mdash;namely, the Dal Cas or descendants of Cormac Cas,
the son of Ollioll Oluim, who was monarch of Ireland in the
beginning of the third century. The O’Quins were chiefs of the
clan called Hy-Ifearnan, and their possessions were bounded by
those of the O’Deas on the east, the O’Loughlins and O’Conors
(Corcomroe) on the west and north-west, the O’Hynes
on the north, and the O’Hehirs on the south. At what period
or from what circumstance the O’Quins lost their ancient
patrimony, we have not been able to discover; but it
would appear to have been about the middle or perhaps close
of the fourteenth century, to which time their genealogy as
chiefs is recorded in that invaluable repository of Irish family
history, the Book of Mac Firbis; and it would seem most probable
that they were transplanted by the O’Briens about this
period to the county of Limerick, in which they are subsequently
found. Their removal is indeed differently accounted
for in a popular legend still current in the barony, and which,
according to our recollections of it, is to the following effect:</p>

<p>In the youth of the last O’Quin of Inchiquin, he saw from
his residence a number of swans of singular beauty frequenting
the west side of the lake, and wandering along its shore.
Wishing, if possible, to possess himself of one of them, he was
in the habit of concealing himself among the rocks and woods
in its vicinity, hoping that he might take them by surprise,
and he was at length successful: one of them became his captive,
and was secretly carried to his residence, when, to his
amazement and delight, throwing off her downy covering, she
assumed the form of a beautiful woman, and shortly after became
his wife. Previous to the marriage, however, she imposed
certain conditions on her lover as the price of her consent,
to which he willingly agreed. These were&mdash;first, that
their union should be kept secret; secondly, that he should
not receive any visitors at his mansion, particularly those
of the O’Briens; and, lastly, that he should wholly abstain
from gambling. For some years these conditions were
strictly adhered to; they lived in happiness together, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
two children blessed their union. But it happened unfortunately
at length that at the neighbouring races at Cood he fell
in with the O’Briens, by whom he was hospitably treated; and
being induced to indulge in too much wine, he forgot his engagements
to his wife, and invited them to his residence on a certain
day to repay their kindness to him. His wife heard of
this invitation with sadness, but proceeded without remonstrance
to prepare the feast for his guests. But she did not
grace it with her presence; and when the company had assembled,
and were engaged in merriment, she withdrew to her
own apartment, to which she called her children, and after
embracing them in a paroxysm of grief, which they could not
account for, she took her original feathery covering from a
press in which it had been kept, arrayed herself in it, and
assuming her pristine shape, plunged into the lake, and was
never seen afterwards. On the same night, O’Quin, again
forgetful of the promises he had made her, engaged in play
with Tiege-an-Cood O’Brien, the most distinguished of his
guests, and lost the whole of his property.</p>

<p>The reader is at liberty to believe as much or as little of
this story as he pleases: but at all events the legend is valuable
in a historical point of view, as indicating the period
when the lands of Inchiquin passed into the hands of the
O’Brien family; nor is it wholly improbable that under the
guise of a wild legend may be concealed some indistinct
tradition of such a real occurrence as that O’Quin made a
union long kept hidden, with a person of inferior station, and
that its discovery drew down upon his head the vengeance
of his proud compeers, and led to their removal to another
district of the chiefs of the clan Hy-Ifearnan.</p>

<p>Be this, however, as it may, the ancient family of O’Quin&mdash;more
fortunate than most other Irish families of noble
origin&mdash;has never sunk into obscurity, or been without a
representative of aristocratic rank; and it can at present
boast of a representative among the nobility of the empire in
the person of its justly presumed chief, the noble Earl of
Dunraven.</p>

<p>We have thus slightly touched on the history of the O’Quins,
not only as it was connected with that of the locality which we
had to illustrate, but also as necessary to correct a great error
into which Burke and other modern genealogists have fallen
in their accounts of the origin of the name and descent of this
family. Thus it is stated by those writers that “the surname
is derived from Con Ceadcaha, or Con of the hundred
battles, monarch of Ireland in the second century, whose
grandson was called Cuinn (rather O’Cuinn), that is, the
descendant of Con, when he wielded the sceptre in 254.”
But those writers should not have been ignorant that Con,
which literally signifies the powerful, was a common name in
Ireland both in Christian and Pagan times; and still more,
they should not have been ignorant of the important fact for
a genealogist, that the use of surnames was unknown in Ireland
till the close of the tenth century. The story is altogether
a silly fiction; and as the real origin of the family
appears to be now unknown even to themselves, and as their
pedigree has never as yet been printed, we are tempted to
give it in an English form, translated from the original, preserved
in the books of Lecan and Duald Mac Firbis:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>“Conor O’Quinn,</li>
<li>the son of Donell,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Donell,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Thomas,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Donell,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Donogh,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Giolla Seanain,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Donogh,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Morough,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Corc, who was the tutor of Murtogh O’Brien (the great grandson of Brian Boru),</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Feidhleachair,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Niall, who was henchman to Morough, the son of Brian Boru, whose fate he shared in the battle of Clontarf,</li>
<li><span class="ditto">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Conn, from whom the name is derived.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The pedigree is carried up from this Con through eighteen
generations to Cormac Cas, the son of Ollioll Oluim, and the
common progenitor of all the tribes of the Dal-Cassians.</p>

<p>In this notice we may add, as an evidence of the ancient
rank of the family, that the Irish annalists at the year 1188
record the death of Edaoin, the daughter of O’Quin, Queen
of Munster, on her pilgrimage at Derry in that year. She
appears to have been the wife of Mortogh O’Brien, who died
without issue in 1168, and was succeeded by his brother
Donald More, the last king of all Munster.</p>

<p>The Castle of Inchiquin is referred to in the Irish Annals
as the residence of the chiefs of the O’Brien family, at the
years 1542, 1559, and 1573; but the notices contain no interest
to the general reader.</p>

<p class="right">P.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ANCIENT IRISH LITERATURE&mdash;No. II.</h2>

<p>In a preceding paper under this heading we lately gave a
sample from the lighter class of native Irish poetry of the seventeenth
century, namely, “The Woman of Three Cows.”
We have now to present our readers with a specimen of a
more serious character, belonging to the same age&mdash;an Elegy
on the death of the Tironian and Tirconnellian princes, who
having fled with others from Ireland in the year 1607, and
afterwards dying at Rome, were there interred on St Peter’s
Hill, in one grave.</p>

<p>The poem is the production of O’Donnell’s bard, Owen
Roe Mac an Bhaird, or Ward, who accompanied the family
in their flight, and is addressed to Nuala, O’Donnell’s sister,
who was also one of the fugitives. As the circumstances connected
with the flight of the Northern Earls, and which led to
the subsequent confiscation of the six Ulster Counties by
James I., may not be immediately in the recollection of many
of our readers, it may be proper briefly to state, that their
departure from this country was caused by the discovery of a
letter directed to Sir William Ussher, Clerk of the Council,
which was dropped in the Council-chamber on the 7th of May,
and which accused the Northern chieftains generally of a conspiracy
to overthrow the government. Whether this charge
was founded in truth or not, it is not necessary for us to express
any opinion; but as in some degree necessary to the
illustration of the poem, and as an interesting piece of hitherto
unpublished literature in itself, we shall here, as a preface to
the poem, extract the following account of the flight of the
Northern Earls, as recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters,
and translated by Mr O’Donovan:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Maguire (Cuconnaught) and Donogh, son of Mahon, who
was son of the Bishop O’Brien, sailed in a ship to Ireland, and
put in at the harbour of Swilly. They then took with them
from Ireland the Earl O’Neill (Hugh, son of Ferdoragh) and
the Earl O’Donnell (Rory, son of Hugh, who was son of Magnus)
and many others of the nobles of the province of Ulster.
These are the persons who went with O’Neill, namely, his
Countess, Catherina, daughter of Magennis, and her three
sons; Hugh, the Baron, John and Brian; Art Oge, son of
Cormac, who was son of the Baron; Ferdoragh, son of Con,
who was son of O’Neill; Hugh Oge, son of Brian, who was
son of Art O’Neill; and many others of his most intimate
friends. These were they who went with the Earl O’Donnell,
namely, Caffer, his brother, with his sister Nuala; Hugh,
the Earl’s child, wanting three weeks of being one year old;
Rose, daughter of O’Doherty and wife of Caffer, with her son
Hugh, aged two years and three months; his (Rory’s) brother
son Donnell Oge, son of Donnell, Naghtan son of Calvach,
who was son of Donogh Cairbreach O’Donnell, and
many others of his intimate friends. They embarked on the
Festival of the Holy Cross in Autumn.</p>

<p>This was a distinguished company; and it is certain that
the sea has not borne and the wind has not wafted in modern
times a number of persons in one ship more eminent, illustrious
or noble, in point of genealogy, heroic deeds, valour, feats
of arms, and brave achievements, than they. Would that God
had but permitted them to remain in their patrimonial inheritances
until the children should arrive at the age of manhood!
Woe to the heart that meditated, woe to the mind that conceived,
woe to the council that recommended the project of
this expedition, without knowing whether they should, to the
end of their lives, be able to return to their native principalities
or patrimonies.”</p>

<h2 class="gap4">BOB PENTLAND, <span class="smaller">OR THE</span> GAUGER OUTWITTED.</h2>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</p>

<p>That the Irish are a ready-witted people, is a fact to the truth
of which testimony has been amply borne both by their friends
and enemies. Many causes might be brought forward to
account for this questionable gift, if it were our intention to
be philosophical; but as the matter has been so generally conceded,
it would be but a waste of logic to prove to the world
that which the world cares not about, beyond the mere fact
that it is so. On this or any other topic one illustration is
worth twenty arguments, and, accordingly, instead of broaching
a theory we shall relate a story.</p>

<p>Behind the hill or rather mountain of Altnaveenan lies
one of those deep and almost precipitous vallies, on which the
practised eye of an illicit distiller would dwell with delight, as
a topography not likely to be invaded by the unhallowed feet
of the gauger and his red-coats. In point of fact, the spot
we speak of was from its peculiarly isolated situation nearly
invisible, unless to such as came very close to it. Being so
completely hemmed in and concealed by the round and angular
projections of the mountain hills, you could never dream of
its existence at all, until you came upon the very verge of the
little precipitous gorge which led into it. This advantage of
position was not, however, its only one. It is true indeed that
the moment you had entered it, all possibility of its being applied
to the purposes of distillation at once vanished, and you
consequently could not help exclaiming, “what a pity that so
safe and beautiful a nook should have not a single spot on
which to erect a still-house, or rather on which to raise a sufficient
stream of water to the elevation necessary for the process
of distilling.” If a gauger actually came to the little
chasm, and cast his scrutinizing eye over it, he would immediately
perceive that the erection of a private still in such a
place was a piece of folly not generally to be found in the
plans of those who have recourse to such practices.</p>

<p>This absence, however, of the requisite conveniences was
only apparent, not real. To the right, about one hundred
yards above the entrance to it, ran a ledge of rocks, some
fifty feet high, or so. Along their lower brows, near the
ground, grew thick matted masses of long heath, which
covered the entrance to a cave about as large and as high as
an ordinary farm-house. Through a series of small fissures
in the rocks which formed its roof, descended a stream of
clear soft water, precisely in body and volume such as was
actually required by the distiller; but, unless by lifting up
this mass of heath, no human being could for a moment imagine
that there existed any such grotto, or so unexpected and
easy an entrance to it. Here there was a private still-house
made by the hand of nature herself, such as no art or ingenuity
of man could equal.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that about the period we write of, there
lived in our parish two individuals so antithetical to each
other in their pursuits of life, that we question whether
throughout all the instinctive antipathies of nature we could
find any two animals more destructive of each other than the
two we mean&mdash;to wit, Bob Pentland the gauger, and little
George Steen the illicit distiller. Pentland was an old,
stanch, well-trained fellow, of about fifty years or more,
steady and sure, and with all the characteristic points of the
high-bred gauger about him. He was a tallish man, thin but
lathy, with a hooked nose that could scent the tread of a distiller
with the keenness of a slew-hound; his dark eye was
deep-set, circumspect, and roguish in its expression, and his
shaggy brow seemed always to be engaged in calculating
whereabouts his inveterate foe, little George Steen, that eternally
blinked him, when almost in his very fangs, might then
be distilling. To be brief, Pentland was proverbial for his
sagacity and adroitness in detecting distillers, and little
George was equally proverbial for having always baffled him,
and that, too, sometimes under circumstances where escape
seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>The incidents which we are about to detail occurred
at that period of time when the collective wisdom of our legislators
thought it advisable to impose a fine upon the whole
townland in which the still head and worm might be found;
thus opening a door for knavery and fraud, and, as it proved
in most cases, rendering the innocent as liable to suffer for an
offence they never contemplated as the guilty who planned
and perpetrated it. The consequence of such a law was, that
still-houses were always certain to be erected either at the
very verge of the neighbouring districts, or as near them as
the circumstances of convenience and situation would permit.
The moment of course that the hue-and-cry of the gauger and
his myrmidons was heard upon the wind, the whole apparatus
was immediately heaved over the <i lang="ga">mering</i> to the next townland,
from which the fine imposed by parliament was necessarily
raised, whilst the crafty and offending district actually
escaped. The state of society generated by such a blundering
and barbarous statute as this, was dreadful. In the course
of a short time, reprisals, law-suits, battles, murders, and
massacres, multiplied to such an extent throughout the whole
country, that the sapient senators who occasioned such commotion
were compelled to repeal their own act as soon as they
found how it worked. Necessity, together with being the
mother of invention, is also the cause of many an accidental
discovery. Pentland had been so frequently defeated by little
George, that he vowed never to rest until he had secured him;
and George on the other hand frequently told him&mdash;for they
were otherwise on the best terms&mdash;that he defied him, or as
he himself more quaintly expressed it, “that he defied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
devil, the world, and Bob Pentland.” The latter, however,
was a very sore thorn in his side, and drove him from place
to place, and from one haunt to another, until he began to despair
of being able any longer to outwit him, or to find within
the parish any spot at all suitable for distillation with which
Pentland was not acquainted. In this state stood matters
between them, when George fortunately discovered at the hip
of Altnaveenan hill the natural grotto we have just sketched
so briefly. Now, George was a man, as we have already
hinted, of great fertility of resources; but there existed in the
same parish another distiller who outstripped him in that farsighted
cunning which is so necessary in misleading or circumventing
such a sharp-scented old hound as Pentland.
This was little Mickey M’Quade, a short-necked squat little
fellow with bow legs, who might be said rather to creep in his
motion than to walk. George and Mickey were intimate
friends, independently of their joint antipathy against the
gauger, and, truth to tell, much of the mortification and many
of the defeats which Pentland experienced at George’s hands,
were, <i lang="la">sub rosa</i>, to be attributed to Mickey. George was a distiller
from none of the motives which generally actuate others
of that class. He was in truth an analytic philosopher&mdash;a natural
chemist never out of some new experiment&mdash;and we have
reason to think might have been the Kane or Faraday or
Dalton of his day, had he only received a scientific education.
Not so honest Mickey, who never troubled his head about an
experiment, but only thought of making a good running, and
defeating the gauger. The first thing of course that George
did, was to consult Mickey, and both accordingly took a walk
up to the scene of their future operations. On examining it,
and fully perceiving its advantages, it might well be said that
the look of exultation and triumph which passed between them
was not unworthy of their respective characters.</p>

<p>“This will do,” said George. “Eh&mdash;don’t you think we’ll
put our finger in Pentland’s eye yet?” Mickey spat sagaciously
over his beard, and after a second glance gave one grave
grin which spoke volumes. “It’ll do,” said he; “but there’s
one point to be got over that maybe you didn’t think of; an’
you know that half a blink, half a point, is enough for Pentland.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do with the smoke when the fire’s
lit? There’ll be no keepin’ <em>that</em> down. Let but Pentland see
as much smoke risin’ as would come out of an ould woman’s
dudeen, an’ he’d have us.”</p>

<p>George started, and it was clear by the vexation and disappointment
which were visible on his brow that unless this
untoward circumstance could be managed, their whole plan
was deranged, and the cave of no value.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” he inquired of his cooler companion.
“If we can’t get over this, we may bid good bye to it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mickey; “I’ll manage it, and <em>do</em> Pentland
still.” “Ay, but how?”</p>

<p>“It’s no matter. Let us not lose a minute in settin’ to
work. Lave the other thing to me; an’ if I don’t account for
the smoke without discoverin’ the entrance to the still, I’ll
give you lave to crop the ears off my head.”</p>

<p>George knew the cool but steady self-confidence for which
Mickey was remarkable, and accordingly, without any further
interrogatory, they both proceeded to follow up their plan of
operations.</p>

<p>In those times when distillation might be truly considered
as almost universal, it was customary for farmers to build
their out-houses with secret chambers and other requisite partitions
necessary for carrying it on. Several of them had private
stores built between false walls, the entrance to which
was only known to a few, and many of them had what were
called <em>Malt-steeps</em> sunk in hidden recesses and hollow gables,
for the purpose of steeping the barley, and afterwards of
turning and airing it, until it was sufficiently hard to be kiln-dried
and ground. From the mill it was usually conveyed to
the still-house upon what were termed <em>Slipes</em>, a kind of car
that was made without wheels, in order the more easily to
pass through morasses and bogs which no wheeled vehicle
could encounter.</p>

<p>In the course of a month or so, George and Mickey, aided
by their friends, had all the apparatus of keeve, hogshead, &amp;c.,
together with still head and worm, set up and in full work.</p>

<p>“And now, Mickey,” inquired his companion, “how will
you manage about the smoke? for you know that the two
worst informers against a private distiller, barrin’ a <em>stag</em>, is
a smoke by day an’ a fire by night.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” replied Mickey; “an’ a rousin’ smoke we’ll
have, for fraid a little puff wouldn’t do us. Come, now, an’
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>They both ascended to the top, where Mickey had closed
all the open fissures of the roof with the exception of that
which was directly over the fire of the still. This was at best
not more than six inches in breadth and about twelve long.
Over it he placed a piece of strong plate iron perforated with
holes, and on this he had a fire of turf, beside which sat a little
boy who acted as a vidette. The thing was simple but effective.
Clamps of turf were at every side of them, and the boy
was instructed, if the gauger, whom he well knew, ever appeared,
to heap on fresh fuel, so as to increase the smoke in
such a manner as to induce him to suppose that <em>all</em> he saw of
it proceeded merely from the fire before him. In fact, the
smoke from the cave below was so completely identified with
and lost in that which was emitted from the fire above, that
no human being could penetrate the mystery, if not made previously
acquainted with it. The writer of this saw it during
the hottest process of distillation, and failed to make the discovery,
although told that the still-house was within a circle
of three hundred yards, the point he stood on being considered
the centre. On more than one occasion has he absconded
from home, and spent a whole night in the place, seized with
that indescribable fascination which such a scene holds forth
to youngsters, as well as from his irrepressible anxiety to hear
the old stories and legends with the recital of which they generally
pass the night.</p>

<p>In this way, well provided against the gauger&mdash;indeed much
better than our readers are yet aware of, as they shall understand
by and bye&mdash;did George, Mickey, and their friends, proceed
for the greater part of a winter without a single visit
from Pentland. Several successful runnings had come off,
which had of course turned out highly profitable, and they
were just now preparing to commence their last, not only for
the season, but the last they should ever work together, as
George was making preparations to go early in the spring to
America. Even this running was going on to their satisfaction,
and the singlings had been thrown again into the still,
from the worm of which projected the strong medicinal <em>first-shot</em>
as the doubling commenced&mdash;this last term meaning the
spirit in its pure and finished state. On this occasion the
two worthies were more than ordinarily anxious, and certainly
doubled their usual precautions against a surprise, for
they knew that Pentland’s visits resembled the pounces of a
hawk or the springs of a tiger more than any thing else to
which they could compare them. In this they were not disappointed.
When the doubling was about half finished, he made
his appearance, attended by a strong party of reluctant soldiers&mdash;for
indeed it is due to the military to state that they
never took delight in harassing the country people at the
command of a keg-hunter, as they generally nicknamed the
gauger. It had been arranged that the vidette at the iron plate
should whistle a particular tune the moment that the gauger
or a red-coat, or in fact any person whom he did not know,
should appear. Accordingly, about eight o’clock in the morning
they heard the little fellow in his highest key whistling up
that well-known and very significant old Irish air called “Go
to the devil an’ shake yourself”&mdash;which in this case was applied
to the gauger in any thing but an allegorical sense.</p>

<p>“Be the pins,” which was George’s usual oath, “be the
pins, Mickey, it’s over with us&mdash;Pentland’s here, for there’s
the sign.”</p>

<p>Mickey paused for a moment and listened very gravely;
then squirting out a tobacco spittle, “Take it aisy,” said
he; “I have half a dozen fires about the hills, any one as like
this as your right hand is to your left. I didn’t spare trouble,
for I knew that if we’d get over this day, we’d be out of
his power.”</p>

<p>“Well, my good lad,” said Pentland, addressing the vidette,
“what’s this fire for?”</p>

<p>“What is it for, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you don’t let me know instantly, I’ll blow your
brains out, and get you hanged and transported afterwards.”
This he said with a thundering voice, cocking a large horse
pistol at the same time.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said the boy, “it’s watchin’ a still I am; but
be the hole o’ my coat if you tell upon me, it’s broilin’ upon
these coals I’ll be soon.”</p>

<p>“Where is the still then? An’ the still-house, where is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, begorra, as to where the still or still-house is, they
wouldn’t tell <em>me</em> that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, sirra, didn’t you say this moment you were watching
a still?”</p>

<p>“I meant, sir,” replied the lad with a face that spoke of
pure idiocy, “that it was the gauger I was watchin’, an’ I
was to whistle upon my fingers to let the boy at that fire on
the hill there above know that he was comin’.”</p>

<p>“Who told you to do so?”</p>

<p>“Little George, sir, an’ Mickey M’Quade.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, right enough there, my lad&mdash;two of the most notorious
schemers unhanged they are both. But now, like a
good boy, tell me the truth, an’ I’ll give you the price of a
pair of shoes. Do you know where the still or still-house is?
Because if you do, an’ won’t tell me, here are the soldiers at
hand to make a prisoner of you; an’ if they do, all the world
can’t prevent you from being hanged, drawn, and quartered.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bad cess may seize the morsel o’ me knows that; but
if you’ll give me the money, sir, I’ll tell you who can bring
you to it, for he tould me yestherday mornin’ that he knew,
an’ offered to bring me there last night, if I’d steal him a bottle
that my mother keeps the holy water in at home, tal he’d
put whisky in it.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, who is this boy?”</p>

<p>“Do you know Harry Neil, or Mankind, sir?”</p>

<p>“I do, my good boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a son of his, sir; an’ look, sir; do you see the
smoke farthest up to the right, sir?”</p>

<p>“To the right? Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis there, sir, that Darby Neil is watchin’; and he
<em>says</em> he knows.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been watching here?”</p>

<p>“This is only the third day, sir, for <em>me</em>; but the rest, them
boys above, has been here a good while.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen nobody stirring about the hills since you
came?”</p>

<p>“Only once, sir, yesterday, I seen two men having an empty
sack or two, runnin’ across the hill there above.”</p>

<p>At this moment the military came up, for he had himself run
forward in advance of them, and he repeated the substance of
his conversation with our friend the vidette. Upon examining
the stolidity of his countenance, in which there certainly was
a woful deficiency of meaning, they agreed among themselves
that his appearance justified the truth of the story which he
told the gauger, and upon being still further interrogated,
they were confirmed that none but a stupid lout like himself
would entrust to his keeping any secret worth knowing.
They now separated themselves into as many detached parties
as there were fires burning on the hills about them, the
gauger himself resolving to make for that which Darby Neil
had in his keeping, for he could not help thinking that the
vidette’s story was too natural to be false. They were just in
the act of separating themselves to pursue their different
routes, when the lad said,</p>

<p>“Look, sir! look, sir! bad scran be from me but there’s a still
any way. Sure I often seen a still; that’s jist like the one that
Philip Hogan the tinker mended in George Steen’s barn.”</p>

<p>“Hollo, boys,” exclaimed Pentland, “stoop! stoop! they
are coming this way, and don’t see us: no, hang them, no!
they have discovered us now, and are off towards Mossfield.
By Jove this will be a bitter trick if they succeed; confound
them, they are bent for Ballagh, which is my own property;
and may I be hanged if we do not intercept them; but it is I
myself who will have to pay the fine.”</p>

<p>The pursuit instantly commenced with a speed and vigour
equal to the ingenuity of this singular act of retaliation on
the gauger. Pentland himself being long-winded from much
practice in this way, and being further stimulated by the prospective
loss which he dreaded, made as beautiful a run of it
as any man of his years could do. It was all in vain, however.
He merely got far enough to see the still head and
worm heaved across the march ditch into his own property,
and to reflect after seeing it that he was certain to have the
double consolation of being made a standing joke of for life,
and of paying heavily for the jest out of his own pocket. In the
mean time, he was bound of course to seize the still, and report
the caption; and as he himself farmed the townland in question,
the fine was levied to the last shilling, upon the very
natural principle that if he had been sufficiently active and
vigilant, no man would have attempted to set up a still so convenient
to his own residence and property.</p>

<p>This manœuvre of keeping in reserve an old or second set
of apparatus, for the purpose of acting the lapwing and misleading
the gauger, was afterwards often practised with success;
but the first discoverer of it was undoubtedly Mickey
M’Quade, although the honour of the discovery is attributed
to his friend George Steen. The matter, however, did not
actually end here, for in a few days afterwards some malicious
wag&mdash;in other words, George himself&mdash;had correct information
sent to Pentland touching the locality of the cavern and
the secret of its entrance. On this occasion the latter brought
a larger military party than usual along with him, but it was
only to make him feel that he stood in a position if possible
more ridiculous than the first. He found indeed the marks of
recent distillation in the place, but nothing else. Every vessel
and implement connected with the process had been removed,
with the exception of one bottle of whisky, to which
was attached by a bit of twine the following friendly note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr Pentland, Sir</span>&mdash;Take this bottle home and drink
your own health. You can’t do less. It was distilled <em>under
your nose</em> the first day you came to look for us, and bottled
for you while you were speaking to the little boy that made
a hare of you. Being distilled then under your nose, let it be
drunk in the same place, and don’t forget while doing so to
drink the health of</p>

<p class="right">G. S.”</p>

</div>

<p>The incident went abroad like wildfire, and was known
everywhere. Indeed for a long time it was the standing topic
of the parish; and so sharply was it felt by Pentland that
he could never keep his temper if asked, “Mr Pentland, when
did you see little George Steen?”&mdash;a question to which he
was never known to give a civil reply.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE GLOBE OF THE EARTH.</h2>

<p>We were surprised very much some time ago at considering
how much of the surface of the globe is covered by the waters
of the lakes and oceans, and took the opportunity then of adverting
to the importance of water in the general economy of
nature. When, however, we pass to the consideration of the
magnitude of the earth itself, the relative proportion of water
appears to be much less considerable.</p>

<p>Although there are many places in the great Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans where the depth of water is very great, yet it
has been deduced from principles that are not liable to much
error, that the general or average depth does not exceed
three miles. It may appear very strange that we can assert
any thing positive about the depth of water in those seas, that
are to the lines used for sounding quite unfathomable; but it
is effected very simply. Every person has seen a wave advancing
along the level surface of a canal, and by observing
with a watch, it could easily be found to move more quickly
at some times than at others. The deeper any part of the
canal is, the more rapidly does the wave move along; and
partly by experiment, and partly by reasoning, the connection
between the depth of the water and velocity of the wave has
been discovered. Now, the tide which comes to Dublin every
twelve hours is produced by the influence of the sun and
moon on the vast body of water in the Southern Pacific Ocean;
and the great wave there formed turns round Cape Horn,
and passes up the Atlantic Ocean, to arrive at the coasts of
Europe and North America. The time occupied by this
great wave in passing from one end to the other of the Atlantic
can thus be known, and, precisely as in a canal, the depth
of water thus calculated.</p>

<p>The circumference of the earth at its widest part is about
25,000, and its diameter 8000 miles. Hence the sheet of water
which constitutes the ocean forms but 3-4000ths of its thickness,
or nearly the same proportion as if we took an eighteen
inch globe, and having spilled water on its surface, allowed all
the excess of water to drain off. The remaining wetness
would represent pretty nearly the condition of the waters of the
ocean on the surface of the earth. By this means we can form,
though obscurely, to our minds, an idea of the great magnitude
of the earth itself. This magnitude renders also very
inconsiderable those inequalities on the surface of the earth
which constitute our highest ridges of mountains. A true
model of Mont Blanc, the highest of European mountains, if
constructed on the eighteen inch globe before referred to, would
be unfelt by a finger drawn along its surface, and it would
be only some of the highest peaks of the Andes and Himalayah
that could be distinctly felt. Where man also employs
his most gigantic energies and greatest efforts of skill to penetrate
below the surface, forming mines by which the supplies
of coal, of iron, of copper, and other minerals, have been
obtained from the earliest times, the cavities that he makes can
only be compared with the trace given by the point of a pin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
that had lightly touched the globe, and which would require a
favourable incidence of light to see.</p>

<p>The earth is therefore almost perfectly a smooth and solid
ball. It is, however, almost certain that it was not always
solid. It is, on the contrary, almost certain that at a period
far exceeding in remoteness any time of which mere human
indications can be found, the globe of the earth was one mass
of liquid matter, heated to a degree exceeding our most intense
fires, and wherein were melted all together the various
elements which have since arranged themselves into their present
forms. From having been thus liquid, the earth, which,
revolving on its axis, produces by the side it turns to the sun
the alternating day and night, has bulged out where the rotation
of the surface is most rapid, at the equator, and has become
flattened at the extremities of its axis, at the poles, just
as a thin hoop which we spin round becomes compressed.
The amount of this flattening is however very small. The
equatorial diameter of the earth being accurately 7925, and
the polar diameter being 7898, the compression is 27 miles.</p>

<p>To account for the existence of this compression, the earth
must have been originally liquid, for otherwise the rotation
on its axis could not have generated this regular form. If it
had been solid when it began to revolve, it should either have
retained its original form, or it should have broken in pieces;
but certainly unless it had been liquid, it could not have arrived
at the exact degree of flattening which its velocity of
rotation should have produced in a liquid mass.</p>

<p>The intensely heated and liquid earth, revolving in the cold
and empty spaces of the planetary system, gradually must
have lost its excess of heat. Cooling most rapidly at the
surface, it there solidified, and generated the first rocks. The
loss of heat still going on, the solidification proceeded to a
greater and greater depth, and should ultimately have reduced
the earth to the same temperature as the empty space among
the stars. The temperature of space has been calculated to be
almost the same as that in the winter at Melville Island, in northernmost
America, that is, 56 deg. below zero, or as far below
the freezing point of water as the temperature of the hottest
water that the hand can bear is above it. The earth is, however,
not allowed to cool to that degree. It receives from the
sun by radiation a quantity of heat which counteracts its tendency
to cool, and hence the mean temperature of the surface
of the earth has remained the same from the earliest historical
epochs. In fact, at the surface we can find no trace of that
original and internal great heat, the temperature of the surface
of the earth being regulated altogether by the effect of
the sun’s rays; but if we dig down to a moderate depth, about
45 feet, the influence of the sun becomes insensible. Within
that space also we can detect a very curious and important
arrangement of the heat. It is not that the whole surface becomes
warmed in summer and cold in winter, but the heat
which is received from the sun in one summer travels by conduction
beneath the surface, and is succeeded by the heat of
the next summer, an intervening and cooler layer corresponding
to the winter time, so that at a depth of 20 feet we may detect
the heat which had fallen upon the surface four or five
years before, this space of 45 feet being formed of numerous
layers like the coatings of an onion, one for each year, until
becoming less and less distinct, according as the depth increases,
they join together in forming the layer of invariable
temperature in which all the effect of the sun’s heat is lost.</p>

<p>If we dig down still farther, the earth, though having lost
the heating power of the sun, becomes sensibly warmer. The
greater the depth to which we descend, the higher is the temperature
found to be. Thus, where deep sinkings have been
made for mines or wells, the air or water at the bottom is
found to be much higher in temperature than at the invariable
layer which gives the mean temperature of the place.
This observation was first made in the case of the deep mines
in Cornwall, and, although for some time ascribed to the presence
of the workmen and the burning lamps, has since been
verified by observations in all parts of Europe, and such agreement
found, that the law connecting the temperature with the
depth has been at least approximately determined.</p>

<p>It is found, counting from the invariable layer, that the temperature
increases about one degree of Fahrenheit’s scale for
every fifty feet in depth. Thus, a well having been sunk at
Rudersdorff to a depth of 630 feet, the water at the bottom
was found to be 67 degrees, while the mean temperature was
50 degrees. In a coal mine at Newcastle, which reaches to a
depth of 1584 feet, the mean temperature of the surface being
48 degrees, the thermometer was found to stand at 73 degrees
in the lowest part of the mine, and hence the elevation of temperature
was 25 degrees. Observations elsewhere vary between
these limits; but the general result is, that the rise is
one degree for about every fifty feet, as above stated.</p>

<p>When we consider the great magnitude of the earth, and
observe the rapidity with which the increase of temperature
occurs, it will strike every person that we in reality inhabit
a mere pellicle or skin, which has formed by cooling upon the
surface, whilst all the internal mass of our globe may still be in
the same state of igneous fusion and tumultuous action of elements,
from which its present mineral constitution on the surface
has resulted. For although it has cooled so far that at
the surface all traces of its central fires have disappeared,
yet at a mile and a half below the surface the temperature is
such as should boil water: at a depth of five miles, lead would
melt. Thirty miles below the surface, cast iron, and all those
rocks which are generally the product of volcanoes in action,
as trap and basalt, would fuse; and hence we may consider
those terrific phenomena which have so frequently desolated
some of the most beautiful districts of the earth, as being
minute apertures or cracks in the thin coating of our planet,
and giving vent from time to time to some small portions of
the internal fires which work beneath.</p>

<p>Additional evidence of the existence of this central heat
may be derived from the peculiarity of springs. Those springs
which carry off and are supplied with water from the surface,
change their temperature with the season, being in winter
cold, but in summer warm. Others, deriving their waters from
a deeper layer of soil, as from the stratum of constant heat,
are always the same, and, possessing the mean temperature
of the place, feel warm in winter and cold in summer. Such
springs exist in every country, and are very useful in ascertaining
the mean temperature, for in place of watching
a thermometer for a year, and taking averages, it is only
necessary to select with proper caution such a deeply supplied
spring, and by observing the temperature of its waters, the
mean temperature of the place is found.</p>

<p>A certain quantity of the water which is absorbed by the
ground after rain must penetrate to a great depth, must
descend, in fact, until at 1½ miles it is boiled and driven up
again to find some outlet as a spring. In rising up, however,
it is for the most part cooled; but having charged itself with
various saline and metallic bodies, under the most favourable
circumstances of high temperature and pressure, it issues as
a hot mineral spring or spa. On getting into the air, it generally
abandons a great part of what it had dissolved, and
forms in many cases enormous depositions of solid rock.</p>

<p>A company in Paris have formed the idea of using the water
thus heated by the powers below, for the purposes of public
baths. The neighbourhood of Paris is peculiarly fitted for
what are termed Artesian wells, in which the water often rises
considerably above the surface of the ground. Under the
auspices of this company, a well has been sunk already to
the depth of 1600 feet, and water obtained at 77 degrees; but
to obtain natural hot water at a temperature of 100 degrees,
which would be required for bathing purposes, an additional
depth of probably as much more will be required. It is said
the projectors are not now sanguine of its pecuniary success.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">The Secret of Success in Life.</span>&mdash;In no department of
life do men rise to eminence who have not undergone a long
and diligent preparation; for whatever be the difference in the
mental power of individuals, it is the cultivation of the mind
alone that leads to distinction. John Hunter was as remarkable
for his industry as for his talents, of which his museum
alone forms a most extraordinary proof; and if we look around
and contemplate the history of those men whose talents and
acquirements we must esteem, we find that their superiority
of knowledge has been the result of great labour and diligence.
It is an ill-founded notion to say that merit in the
long-run is neglected. It is sometimes joined to circumstances
that may have a little influence in counteracting it, as an unfortunate
manner and temper; but generally it meets with its
due reward. The world are not fools&mdash;every person of merit
has the best chance of success; and who would be ambitious
of public approbation, if it had not the power of discriminating?&mdash;<cite>Physic

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
